### **Use Case 1: Gesture-Based Projector Detection**

**Title**  
Gesture-Based Projector Detection

**Goal in Context**  
Allow a user to manipulate the scene generated by a projector using hand gestures.

**Scope**  
System

**Level**  
User goal

**Primary Actor**  
User

**Stakeholders**
- **User**: Wants to interact with the scene generated by the projector using gestures.
- **System**: Needs to detect gestures accurately and trigger the correct projector response.

**Preconditions**
- System is powered on.
- Camera is set to use **GestureRecognition** strategy.
- Projector is registered as an observer to the camera.

**Guarantees**
- If a valid gesture is detected, the projector analyzes the action.
- The user receives visual confirmation via projection.
- The system logs the action. 

**Main Success Scenario**
1. **User enters the camera’s field of view.**
2. **User performs a predefined gesture.**
3. **Camera detects the gesture using the active strategy.**
4. **Camera notifies all registered projectors with the event.**
5. **Projector receives the update and executes the command.**
6. **The scene is modified based on the gesture and projector's response.**

**Extensions**
- **3a. Gesture not recognized** → Camera logs the event; projector's state remains the same.
- **5a. Projector fails to respond** → System retries or alerts the user via status display.  
  


  
### **Use Case 2: Object Tracking Triggers Contextual Projection**

**Title**  
Object Tracking Triggers Contextual Projection

**Goal in Context**  
Automatically project context-aware content when the system detects an object moving within a specific camera zone.

**Scope**  
System

**Level**  
User goal

**Primary Actor**  
System

**Stakeholders**
- **User**: Wants relevant information to appear based on physical interactions.
- **System**: Must identify objects and respond with the correct content.

**Preconditions**
- System is powered on.
- Camera is set to **ObjectTracking** behavior.
- Projector is subscribed to the camera as observer.

**Guarantees**
- A moving object triggers an appropriate projection.
- Content corresponds to the tracked object’s zone or type.

**Main Success Scenario**
1. **An object enters the camera’s detection zone.**
2. **Camera detects movement and classifies the object.**
3. **Camera broadcasts an event to its observers.**
4. **Projector receives the event and executes the command.**
5. **Projector displays the content tied to the object or zone.**

**Extensions**
- **2a. Object not identified** → System ignores movement and logs data.
- **4a. Content not available** → Projector shows a default message or waits for update.
